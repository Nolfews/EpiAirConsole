# EpiAirConsole

## Project Concept & Inspiration
EpiAirConsole is inspired by the AirConsole platform, which allows users to play web-based games where the PC acts as the main screen and mobile devices serve as controllers. The goal is to recreate this experience using a modern web stack, enabling seamless integration of 2D games (built with Phaser.js) and real-time communication between devices via Socket.IO. The project is fully developed in TypeScript for maintainability and scalability.

### Key Features
- PC web page displays the game (main screen)
- Mobile web page acts as a controller (gamepad)
- Real-time communication using Socket.IO
- Modular game integration with Phaser.js (2D games)
- Room system with PIN codes for multi-player sessions
- Player-controller pairing with unique device codes
- All code written in TypeScript

See [ROOMS.md](ROOMS.md) for details on the room system and controller pairing.

## Stack Overview
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, HTML5, SCSS, Socket.IO-client
- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, Socket.IO-server
- **Games:** Phaser.js, TypeScript
- **Mobile:** TypeScript, HTML5, SCSS, Socket.IO-client
- **Monorepo:** Shared node_modules at the root, each part (frontend, backend, games, mobile) has its own package.json and tsconfig.json

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone <repo-url>
	cd EpiAirConsole
	```
2. **Install all dependencies (from the root):**
	```bash
	npm install
	```
	This will install all required packages for every part of the project (frontend, backend, games, mobile) using the shared node_modules.

## How to Run the Project

### Recommended (run from repository root)

This repo uses a single shared `node_modules` at the root. For quick development and testing you can run the backend and the test socket clients from the repo root:

- Start backend in dev (auto-reload):
```bash
npm run backend:dev
```

- Start a test frontend socket client (local test runner):
```bash
npm run socket:frontend
```

- Start a test mobile socket client (local test runner):
```bash
npm run socket:mobile
```

Open the frontend test page at http://localhost:3000/ (served by the backend) to exercise socket flows.

### Alternative: run each part from its folder

If you prefer to run parts independently (build/start from each subfolder) you can still do so:

1. **Start the backend server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run build   # or npm run dev if available
npm start
```

2. **Start the frontend:**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run build   # or npm run dev if available
npm start
```

4. **Add and run games:**
- Each game should be placed in a subfolder of `games/` and built with Phaser.js and TypeScript.
- Build and run games as needed (see each game's README for details).

## Backend server

Run the backend from the repository root (this project uses a single node_modules at the root):

- Dev (auto-reload):
```bash
npm run backend:dev
```
- Build:
```bash
npm run backend:build
```
- Start built version:
```bash
npm run backend:start
```
The backend listens on PORT (default 3000) and exposes a /health route.

## Mobile quick start — connect with your phone

The mobile interface now supports automatic URL detection. This allows you to connect from any device without having to modify the `.env` file each time:

1. **Auto-Detection Mode** (recommended)

   To enable automatic URL detection:

   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Then edit backend/.env and make sure SERVER_URL is commented out or empty
   ```

   With auto-detection enabled:
   - The mobile interface will automatically detect all available IP addresses
   - A dropdown menu will show all possible connection URLs
   - You can easily switch between local IPs and ngrok URLs without editing files
   - Connection settings are remembered during your session

2. **Manual Configuration** (alternative)

   If you prefer to force a specific URL:

   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Then edit backend/.env and set SERVER_URL
   ```

   - To force using a LAN IP (for phones on the same network):
     ```
     SERVER_URL=http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:3000
     ```
   - Or to expose via ngrok (for cross-network / HTTPS access):
     ```
     SERVER_URL=https://<YOUR-NGROK-SUBDOMAIN>.ngrok-free.dev
     ```

## Using ngrok for External Access

ngrok allows you to expose your local server to the internet, making it accessible from any device, even those not on your local network.

### Installing ngrok

1. **Download the latest version of ngrok**:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
   tar xvzf ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
   ```

2. **Make ngrok executable and move it to a directory in your PATH (optional)**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ngrok
   sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/   # requires root/sudo access
   ```

   Alternatively, keep it in your project directory and run it with `./ngrok`

### Setting up ngrok

1. **Sign up for a free account** at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and get your authtoken

2. **Authenticate your ngrok client**:
   ```bash
   ./ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_AUTHTOKEN` with the token from your ngrok dashboard.

### Exposing Your Local Server

1. **Start your backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run backend:dev
   ```

2. **Start ngrok** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   ./ngrok http 3000
   ```
   This creates a tunnel to your local server running on port 3000.

3. **Note the forwarding URL** in the ngrok output:
   ```
   Forwarding    https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok-free.dev -> http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Update your backend/.env file** with this URL:
   ```
   SERVER_URL=https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok-free.dev
   ```

5. **Restart your backend server** to apply the new SERVER_URL.

2. Restart the backend to apply the changes:

	```bash
	npm run backend:dev
	```

3. Check that the backend exposes the configuration (it should show a non-empty `serverUrl` if you set SERVER_URL):

	```bash
	curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3000/config.json
	# -> {"serverUrl":"http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:3000","defaultRoom":"test-room"}
	```

4. Open the mobile page on your phone (on the same network):

	- URL: `http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:3000/mobile.html`
	- The "Server URL" field will be prefilled and disabled if `SERVER_URL` is set.
	- Click "Connect" then "Send Message" to send a message to the backend.

5. Verify reception on the backend

	- Look at the terminal where `npm run backend:dev` is running — you should see socket connection logs and received events (join, message, etc.).

### Accessing the Application

1. **From your computer**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` to access the main frontend
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/mobile.html` to test the mobile interface

2. **From other devices on the same network**:
   - Use your computer's LAN IP: `http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:3000`
   - For the mobile interface: `http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:3000/mobile.html`
   To display your computer's LAN IP address, use the following command in a terminal:

   - **Linux/macOS (show only the main LAN IP):**
      ```bash
      hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
      ```
      or
      ```bash
      ip addr show | awk '/inet / && !/127.0.0.1/ {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -n1
      ```

   - **Windows (show only IPv4 addresses):**
      ```powershell
      ipconfig | findstr /R /C:"IPv4"
      ```

3. **From any device on the internet** (using ngrok):
   - Use the ngrok URL: `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok-free.dev`
   - For the mobile interface: `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok-free.dev/mobile.html`

### Troubleshooting ngrok

- **"ngrok version too old" error**: Download the latest version as described above
- **Authentication failures**: Verify your authtoken on the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
- **Connection issues**: Check if your backend is actually running on port 3000
- **CORS errors**: Make sure your backend allows requests from the ngrok domain

Security notes

- Never commit `backend/.env` (the repo contains `backend/.env.example` only).
- Use ngrok or HTTPS for cross-network tests to avoid mixed-content issues in mobile browsers.
- The free version of ngrok assigns random subdomains each time you restart, so you'll need to update SERVER_URL in your .env file.


## Notes
- All commands should be run from the respective folders in development mode.
- Make sure to use Node.js v18+ and npm v9+ for best compatibility.
- For development, you can use `npm run dev` if available in each part.
- Docker instructions will be added soon for unified launch.

## Quick Postgres (Docker) — local development

If you prefer to run a local Postgres in Docker (recommended to avoid touching the system DB), here's a small set of commands and notes you can copy-paste.

1) Start a Postgres container (use host port 5433 if your system Postgres uses 5432):

```bash
# remove any previous container with the same name (optional)
docker rm -f epi-postgres || true

# start postgres mapped to host port 5433
docker run --name epi-postgres \
	-e POSTGRES_USER=epiuser \
	-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
	-e POSTGRES_DB=epiairconsole \
	-p 5433:5432 -d postgres:15
```

2) Update `backend/.env` to point to the Docker instance (example):

```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5433
DB_USER=epiuser
DB_PASSWORD=secret
DB_NAME=epiairconsole
JWT_SECRET=un-secret-long
```

3) Restart the backend (it will auto-create the `users` table on first run):

```bash
npm run backend:dev
```

4) Verify connectivity and tables (from host):

```bash
# list tables
PGPASSWORD=secret psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5433 -U epiuser -d epiairconsole -c "\dt"
```

Notes
- If port 5432 is free on your machine, you can map to `-p 5432:5432` instead.
- If you see `Ident authentication failed` when connecting to a system Postgres, prefer the Docker option or adjust your system `pg_hba.conf`.
